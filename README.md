### Welcome

**Currently working on:** Backend development using C#.

#### Bot Project: WoW Intelligence Bot
For educational purposes. It plays on a [single player](https://github.com/celguar/spp-classics-cmangos) server where it can interact with other bots.

**Capabilities:**
- Farm NPCs
- Vendor
- Deathrun
- Change zones (!)
- Create path profiles
- Create combat routine
- Change combat routine while running
- Image recognition for object avoidance or targeting
- Target confirmation via database
- Unstuck features
- And much more!

It uses OCR for data extraction, which is horribly inefficient compared to other methods, but its fun to tackle ways to improve it.

**Additional Notes:**
- Reason for making the bot is my own attempt at intelligence. I still have so much to learn, but I hope I can create something that solves its own tasks in a living world with basic instructions. I already have it figured out how the eyes (image recognition) can easily train itself, as pictures it takes of NPCs can be confirmed via the database so the vision will gradually improve without any human feedback. Ive given it basic knowledge of NPCs by scraping pictures of all models from the net. Also some additional textures and buildings by extracting models and projecting them on blender.
- The brain part is the real challenge, but first instinct here would be a personally trained LLM with all WoW data available. This wouldn't make it any intelligentâ€”just knowledgeable. But perhaps that is also essential for intelligence, and a fundamental starting point for it to evolve.
- I chose an MMO because I know it very well. The bot will perceive that world as reality just like we do our own and I can skip the material creation.
  
#### AH Sniper Addon

Created the fastest (legal) AH Sniper addon.
- Saved a lot of milliseconds, but like most "trading bots" you quickly reach peak speed and further improvements hinge on latency.
