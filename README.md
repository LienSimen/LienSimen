### Welcome

Currently working on Backend using c#. Coding is hard. When it gets confusing I try to tell myself there is only setting variables, writing to variables and conditional branching. The rest is syntax sugar.

# Projects

### WoW Bot
For educational purposes. It plays on a [single player](https://github.com/celguar/spp-classics-cmangos) server where it can interact with other bots.

It uses OCR(Optical character recognition) for data extraction, and image recognition for terrain avoidance and npc detection. Both horribly inefficient compared to other methods, but its fun to tackle ways to improve it. And it fascinates me how we can take multiple snapshots of numbers, letters, NPCs, and obstacles every second, translate them into actionable data, and then use that to shape real-time decisions in the game. Now thanks to cuda us casuals can have fun with image recognition training and OCR with our gaming GPUs.

- Reason for making the bot is my own attempt at intelligence. I still have so much to learn, but I hope I can create something that solves its own tasks in a digital world with basic instructions. I already have it figured out how the eyes (image recognition) can easily train itself, as pictures it takes of NPCs can be confirmed via the database so the vision will gradually improve without any human feedback. Ive given it basic knowledge of NPCs by scraping pictures of all models from the net. Also some additional textures and buildings by extracting models and projecting them on blender.
- The brain part is the real challenge, but first instinct here would be a personally trained LLM with all WoW data available. This wouldn't make it any intelligentâ€”just knowledgeable. But perhaps that is also essential for intelligence, and a fundamental starting point for it to evolve.
- An MMO is ideal because its world acts as a lens for how the bot perceive reality so I dont have to worry about material creation.

### AH Sniper Addon

Got annoyed that I was on broadband so made an addon that snipes auctions very fast. Woke me up to the power of creating a personalized addon that dont have to account for anything that would slow it down.
